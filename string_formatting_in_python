      his phone_number is 8099677123

3) %f - to format decimal_numbers/floats in  a string 
e.g. 'the value is %.2f' %(12.56789) 
      Ans: the value is 12.57

4) to specify the total length of the value/add spaces to the value
e.g. 'the value is %8.2f' %(12.56789) #the total length of the float will be 8 and the number of decimal places will be 2, and four spaces 
      will be added to the float to complement the total length of eight.
      Ans: the value is     12.57
      
e.g. 'his name is %10s %('craig')  #the total length will be 10, it will also be complemented by 5 empty spaces.

    #the positions can spoecified by putting 0, 1, and 2 in the bracket in line with its datatype
    #{1:d} - it belongs to the 2nd position and it is an integer
    #{0:s} - it belongs to the first position and it is a string
    Ans: kola's number is 967755, name of friend as balo and amount as 89.568
